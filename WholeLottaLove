You need cooling
Baby I'm not fooling

Back to schooling
A-way down inside
A-honey you need it
I'm gonna give you my love

Want to whole lotta love

Want to whole lotta love
Want to whole lotta love
You've been learning
Um baby I been learning
All them good times baby, baby
I've been year-yearning
A-way, way down inside
A-honey you need-ah

I'm gonna give you my love, ah oh
Whole lotta love
Want to whole lotta love
Want to whole lotta love
Want to whole lotta love
You've been cooling
And baby I've been drooling
All the good times, baby

A-way, way down inside
I'm gonna give ya my love
I'm gonna give ya every inch of my love
I'm gonna give ya my love
Hey!â€¦
